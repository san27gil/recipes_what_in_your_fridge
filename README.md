# Recipes based on what's in your fridge. 👨‍🍳
 Written in Python language, with this code you can finally forget about thinking about what to eat.
<br><br>
There are two ways to use the program: 

1. The first one, you tell him one by one the ingredients you have and he suggests you recipes you can do. It'll shows recipes that contain at least 60% of the ingredients you have. 
2. The other one, and yet the most powerful one (feels like a superpower), the random suggest.
